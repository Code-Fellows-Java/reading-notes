## CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.
CSS is a rule-based language â€” you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.
Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. The .css extension shows that this is a CSS file.

To link styles.css to index.html, add the following line somewhere inside the <head> of the HTML document:
  
  ### <link.rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
