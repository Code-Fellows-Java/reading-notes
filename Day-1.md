## My Growth mindset

>“It’s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your life’s story will develop.” – Dieter F. Uchtdorf

The ability to overcome obstacles has always been a trademark of humanity. From Early hunters walking their prey for miles until they tire and succomb. To Modern examples of day to day office work. The principle exists for both. We must strive to overcome, to look at everything as an oppurtunity to grow, and learn. Doubting ones self is natural, but the ability to adapt, and best the challenge quickly through tenacity is entirely human.

### Daily Charges
- Look at obstacles as an area for growth.
- Accept failure for what it is, a lesson.
- Give everything you have available to you in order to solve the problem, you will regret the lack of persistence in the end.
